* DONE Fix vertices/meshes gl object regeneration
* DONE Check if performance issues are really related to gpu fill rate (yep, it was fill rate)
* TODO Create a render lock mechanism for all the things that could be recompiled interactively
** Create render lock, something along the lines of ``with-render-lock'' macro
** Add render lock to all the things that could be modified interactively
** Don't forget to minimize time spent locked
* TODO Invalidvalue for delete program on shader reload
* TODO Do something about the possibility of multiple fragment data locations in shaders and framebuffer
* TODO Implement all the basic shaders and transformation matrices for them
** 3d
*** Perspective matrix
*** Basic model-view-projection
** 2d 
*** Orthogonal projection matrix
*** Basic model-view-projection

* TODO GL object struct definition macro
Most gl object structs I use tend to follow the same pattern, to some extend I do not want to use classes with inheritance(why?) so I should make a macro or something
* TODO REFACTOR RESTRUCTURE RESOMETHING
