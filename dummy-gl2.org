DummyGL 2 development log thing

<2016-09-08 Thu> Textures
Got textures working, note to self: Next time you work with OpenGL textures don't forget to set texture parameters, they will not work otherwise. 
Also gl-vertices/meshes do not regenerate correctly when something new is added, investigate.

[2016-09-09 Fri] The GPU Fill Rate did it
It appears that the performance drop related to polygon drawing was not in fact limited by GPU fill rate rather than me trying to push too much draw calls/polygons.
If that is actually true, a number optimizations become meaningful (like polygon culling) and the engine could be relatively well performing after all.
This would also explain the fact that the performance drop was non-linear.

<2016-09-11 Sun> Figured out why multiple meshes were not drawing properly
Meshes were not drawing properly because I did not specify element offset when drawing them.
Also I did something for generic uniform setting, I don't quite like it so I should figure out a better way
